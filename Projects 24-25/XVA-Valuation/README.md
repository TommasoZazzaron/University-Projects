Overview:
This project explores credit and funding risk management in derivative portfolios, specifically through the pricing and risk assessment of Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) using advanced quantitative methods.

Key Features:
- Hull-White Model: Implemented to simulate short-rate dynamics, calibrated to market zero-coupon bond prices.
- Interest Rate Swap Pricing: Valuation of IRS using standard market formulas, analyzing Mark-to-Market (MtM) across different tenors.
- Risk Metrics: Computation of Expected Exposure (EE), Potential Future Exposure (PFE), Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).
- Collateralized Contracts: Assessment of CVA and FVA under fully collateralized conditions with a Margin Period of Risk (MPOR).
- Barrier Options Analysis: Evaluation of FVA for a short position in Down-and-In put options via Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC).
