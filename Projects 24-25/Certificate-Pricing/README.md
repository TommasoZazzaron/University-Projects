Overview:
This project evaluates an Investment Certificate issued by Commerzbank, based on the Commerzbank Efficiency Growth Index. The assessment covers both quantitative pricing models and qualitative analysis from investor and issuer perspectives.

Project Breakdown

Quantitative Analysis:
- Index Description: Understanding the Efficiency Growth Index and its components, including the Efficiency Growth Fund and Reference Interest Rate (1-month EURIBOR).
- Index Calculation: Computation of index value through a volatility-controlled weighting mechanism based on daily realized volatility.
- Derivative Pricing: Application of the Black-Scholes model to price the Certificate, assuming a Geometric Brownian Motion for underlying dynamics.
- Volatility and Risk-Free Rate: Analysis includes volatility proxies (rolling average volatility) and interpolated risk-free rates derived from Euribor and swap rates.
- Price Comparison: Evaluation of theoretical prices versus actual issue prices, highlighting discrepancies and implications.

Qualitative Analysis:

- Investor Perspective:
  - Assessment of investment attractiveness, including risk management through volatility control.
  - Analysis of risks (market, counterparty, liquidity, regulatory, currency).
  - Comprehensive evaluation of costs (initial, ongoing, and exit-related).

- Issuer Perspective:
  - Identification of strategic rationale behind the issuance, including market differentiation and risk        management.
  - Examination of benefits such as diversified revenue streams and market presence.
  - Analysis of revenue generation through dynamic hedging, management fees, and trading activity.
